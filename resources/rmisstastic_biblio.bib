We formulate these methods in terms of sequential regression multivariate imputation, which is an iterative procedure in which the missing values of each variable are randomly imputed conditionally on all the other variables in the completed data matrix. We also consider a recalibration procedure for sequential regression imputations. We apply these methods to the 2002 environmental sustainability index, which is a linear aggregation of 64 environmental variables on 142 countries.},

  Abstract                 = {In certain diseases, outcome is the number of morbid events over the course of follow-up. In epilepsy, e.g., daily seizure counts are often used to reflect disease severity. Follow-up of patients in clinical trials of such diseases is often subject to censoring due to patients dying or dropping out. If the sicker patients tend to be censored in such trials, estimates of the treatment effect that do not incorporate the censoring process may be misleading. We extend the shared random effects approach of Wu and Carroll (1988, Biometrics 44, 175-188) to the setting of repeated counts of events. Three strategies are developed. The first is a likelihood-based approach for jointly modeling the count and censoring processes. A shared random effect is incorporated to introduce dependence between the two processes. The second is a likelihood-based approach that conditions on the dropout times in adjusting for informative dropout. The third is a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, which also conditions on the dropout times but makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of the count process. Estimation procedures for each of the approaches are discussed, and the approaches are applied to data from an epilepsy clinical trial. A simulation study is also conducted to compare the various approaches. Through analyses and simulations, we demonstrate the flexibility of the likelihood-based conditional model for analyzing data from the epilepsy trial.},

Despite being used extensively in practice, the theory is not as well developed as that of other imputation methods. We have found that no consensus exists as to the best way to apply the hot deck and obtain inferences from the completed data set. Here we review different forms of the hot deck and existing research on its statistical properties. We describe applications of the hot deck currently in use, including the U.S. Census Bureau's hot deck for the Current Population Survey (CPS). We also provide an extended example of variations of the hot deck applied to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Some potential areas for future research are highlighted.},

Because the imputation uses the principal axes and components, the prediction of the missing values is based on the similarity between individuals and on the relationships between variables. The properties of the method are illustrated via simulations and the quality of the imputation is assessed using real data sets. The method is compared to a recent method (Stekhoven and Buhlmann Bioinformatics 28:113_118, 2011) based on random forest and shows better performance especially for the imputation of categorical variables and situations with highly linear relationships between continuous variables.},

Using a simulation study and real data sets, the method is compared to two classical approaches: multiple imputation based on joint modelling and on fully conditional modelling. Contrary to the others, the proposed method can be easily used on data sets where the number of individuals is less than the number of variables and when the variables are highly correlated. In addition, it provides unbiased point estimates of quantities of interest, such as an expectation, a regression coefficient or a correlation coefficient, with a smaller mean squared error. Furthermore, the widths of the confidence intervals built for the quantities of interest are often smaller whilst ensuring a valid coverage.},

In a missing data model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either (but not necessarily both) a model for the missingness mechanism or a model for the distribution of the complete data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that either a missingness model or a complete data model is correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances, instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct, inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict.

Despite the efficiency of NN algorithms little is known about the effect of these methods on data structure. Methods Simulation on synthetic datasets with different patterns and degrees of missingness were conducted to evaluate the performance of NN with one single neighbor (1NN) and with k neighbors without (kNN) or with weighting (wkNN) in the context of different learning frameworks: plain set, reduced set after ReliefF filtering, bagging, random choice of attributes, bagging combined with random choice of attributes (Random-Forest-like method). Results Whatever the framework, kNN usually outperformed 1NN in terms of precision of imputation and reduced errors in inferential statistics, 1NN was however the only method capable of preserving the data structure and data were distorted even when small values of k neighbors were considered; distortion was more severe for resampling schemas. Conclusions The use of three neighbors in conjunction with ReliefF seems to provide the best trade-off between imputation error and preservation of the data structure. The very same conclusions can be drawn when imputation experiments were conducted on the single proton emission computed tomography (SPECTF) heart dataset after introduction of missing data completely at random.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data are a commonly occurring threat to the validity and efficiency of epidemiologic studies. Perhaps the most common approach to handling missing data is to simply drop those records with 1 or more missing values, in so-called “complete records” or “complete case” analysis. In this paper, we bring together earlier-derived yet perhaps now somewhat neglected results which show that a logistic regression complete records analysis can provide asymptotically unbiased estimates of the association of an exposure of interest with an outcome, adjusted for a number of confounders, under a surprisingly wide range of missing-data assumptions. We give detailed guidance describing how the observed data can be used to judge the plausibility of these assumptions. The results mean that in large epidemiologic studies which are affected by missing data and analyzed by logistic regression, exposure associations may be estimated without bias in a number of settings where researchers might otherwise assume that bias would occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data is a common problem in real-world settings and for this reason has attracted significant attention in the statistical literature. We propose a flexible framework based on formal optimization to impute missing data with mixed continuous and categorical variables. This framework can readily incorporate various predictive models including K nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and decision tree based methods, and can be adapted for multiple imputation. We derive fast first-order methods that obtain high quality solutions in seconds following a general imputation algorithm opt.impute presented in this paper. We demonstrate that our proposed method improves out-of-sample accuracy in large-scale computational experiments across a sample of 84 data sets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In all scenarios of missing at random mechanisms and various missing percentages, opt.impute produces the best overall imputation in most data sets benchmarked against five other methods: mean impute, K-nearest neighbors, iterative knn, Bayesian PCA, and predictive-mean matching, with an average reduction in mean absolute error of 8.3\% against the best cross-validated benchmark method. Moreover, opt.impute leads to improved out-of-sample performance of learning algorithms trained using the imputed data, demonstrated by computational experiments on 10 downstream tasks. For models trained using opt.impute single imputations with 50\% data missing, the average out-of-sample R2 is 0.339 in the regression tasks and the average out-of-sample accuracy is 86.1\% in the classification tasks, compared to 0.315 and 84.4\% for the best cross-validated benchmark method. In the multiple imputation setting, downstream models trained using opt.impute obtain a statistically significant improvement over models trained using multivariate imputation by chained equations (mice) in 8/10 missing data scenarios considered.},

  Abstract={In the analyses of incomplete longitudinal clinical trial data, there has been a shift, away from simple methods that are valid only if the data are missing completely at random, to more principled ignorable analyses, which are valid under the less restrictive missing at random assumption. The availability of the necessary standard statistical software nowadays allows for such analyses in practice. While the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) cannot be ruled out, it is argued that analyses valid under MNAR are not well suited for the primary analysis in clinical trials. Rather than either forgetting about or blindly shifting to an MNAR framework, the optimal place for MNAR analyses is within a sensitivity‐analysis context. One such route for sensitivity analysis is to consider, next to selection models, pattern‐mixture models or shared‐parameter models. The latter can also be extended to a latent‐class mixture model, the approach taken in this article. The performance of the so‐obtained flexible model is assessed through simulations and the model is applied to data from a depression trial.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning compressed representations of multivariate time series (MTS) facilitates data analysis in the presence of noise and redundant information, and for a large number of variates and time steps. However, classical dimensionality reduction approaches are designed for vectorial data and cannot deal explicitly with missing values. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder architecture based on recurrent neural networks to generate compressed representations of MTS. The proposed model can process inputs characterized by variable lengths and it is specifically designed to handle missing data. Our autoencoder learns fixed-length vectorial representations, whose pairwise similarities are aligned to a kernel function that operates in input space and that handles missing values. This allows to learn good representations, even in the presence of a significant amount of missing data. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we evaluate the quality of the learned representations in several classification tasks, including those involving medical data, and we compare to other methods for dimensionality reduction. Successively, we design two frameworks based on the proposed architecture: one for imputing missing data and another for one-class classification. Finally, we analyze under what circumstances an autoencoder with recurrent layers can learn better compressed representations of MTS than feed-forward architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {The success of applications that process data critically depends on the quality of the ingested data. Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic health records are a valuable data source for investigating health-related questions, and propensity score analysis has become an increasingly popular approach to address confounding bias in such investigations. However, because electronic health records are typically routinely recorded as part of standard clinical care, there are often missing values, particularly for potential confounders. In our motivating study -- using electronic health records to investigate the effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on the risk of acute kidney injury -- two key confounders, ethnicity and chronic kidney disease stage, have 59% and 53% missing data, respectively.
The missingness pattern approach (MPA), a variant of the missing indicator approach, has been proposed as a method for handling partially observed confounders in propensity score analysis. In the MPA, propensity scores are estimated separately for each missingness pattern present in the data. Although the assumptions underlying the validity of the MPA are stated in the literature, it can be difficult in practice to assess their plausibility.
In this paper, we explore the MPA's underlying assumptions by using causal diagrams to assess their plausibility in a range of simple scenarios, drawing general conclusions about situations in which they are likely to be violated. We present a framework providing practical guidance for assessing whether the MPA's assumptions are plausible in a particular setting and thus deciding when the MPA is appropriate. We apply our framework to our motivating study, showing that the MPA's underlying assumptions appear reasonable, and we demonstrate the application of MPA to this study.},

  Abstract                 = {Similarity search is fundamental to store and retrieve large volumes of complex data required by many real world applications. A useful mechanism for such concept is the query-by-similarity. Based on their topological properties, metric similarity functions can be used to index sets of data which can be queried effectively and efficiently by the so-called metric access methods. However, data produced by various application domains and the varying data types handled often lead to missing data, hence, they do not follow the metric similarity requirements. As a consequence, missing data cause distortions in the index structure and yield bias in the query answer. In this paper, we propose the Hollow-tree, a novel access method aimed at successfully retrieving data with missing attribute values. It employs new strategies for indexing and searching data elements, capable of handling the missing data issues when the cause of missingness is ignorable. The indexing strategy is based on a family of distance functions that allow measuring the distance between elements with missing values, along with a set of policies able to organize the elements in the index without causing distortions to its internal structure. The searching strategy employs fractal dimension property of the data to achieve accurate query answer while considering data with missing values part of the response. Results from experiments performed on a variety of real and synthetic data sets showed that, while other metric access methods deteriorate with small amounts of missing values, the Hollow-tree maintains a remarkable performance with almost 100\% of precision and recall for range queries and more than 90\% for k-nearest neighbor queries, for up to 40\% of missing values.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple imputation is now a well-established technique for analysing data sets where some units have incomplete observations. Provided that the imputation model is correct, the resulting estimates are consistent. An alternative, weighting by the inverse probability of observing complete data on a unit, is conceptually simple and involves fewer modelling assumptions, but it is known to be both inefficient (relative to a fully parametric approach) and sensitive to the choice of weighting model. Over the last decade, there has been a considerable body of theoretical work to improve the performance of inverse probability weighting, leading to the development of ‘doubly robust’ or ‘doubly protected’ estimators. We present an intuitive review of these developments and contrast these estimators with multiple imputation from both a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.},

This book focuses on a particular statistical method for analysing and drawing inferences from incomplete data, called Multiple Imputation (MI). MI is attractive because it is both practical and widely applicable.

Our approach uses the empirical observed-data distribution and augments it with a nonparametric estimator of the missing-data distributions under a given identifying restriction. Our results apply to a large class of donor-based identifying restrictions that encompasses commonly used ones and can handle

A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

While multiple imputation is a vast improvement over the deletion of cases with missing values, it is often unsuitable for imputing highly non-granular discrete data. We develop a simple technique for imputing missing values in such situations, which is a variant of hot deck imputation, drawing from the conditional distribution of the variable with missing values to preserve the discrete measure of the variable. This method is tested against existing techniques using Monte Carlo analysis and then applied to real data on democratization and modernization theory. Software for our imputation technique is provided in a free, easy-to-use package for the R statistical environment.},

  Abstract                 = {A model is proposed for continuous longitudinal data with non-ignorable or informative drop-out (ID). The model combines a multivariate linear model for the underlying response with a logistic regression model for the drop-out process. The latter incorporates dependence of the probability of drop-out on unobserved, or missing, observations. Parameters in the model are estimated by using maximum likelihood (ML) and inferences drawn through conventional likelihood procedures. In particular, likelihood ratio tests can be used to assess the informativeness of the drop-out process through comparison of the full model with reduced models corresponding to random drop-out (RD) and completely random processes. A simulation study is used to assess the procedure in two settings: the comparison of time trends under a linear regression model with autocorrelated errors and the estimation of period means and treatment differences from a four-period four-treatment crossover trial. It is seen in both settings that, when data are generated under an ID process, the ML estimators from the ID model do not suffer from the bias that is present in the ordinary least squares and RD ML estimators. The approach is then applied to three examples. These derive from a milk protein trial involving three groups of cows, milk yield data from a study of mastitis in dairy cattle and data from a multicentre clinical trial on the study of depression. All three examples provide evidence of an underlying ID process, two with some strength. It is seen that the assumption of an ID rather than an RD process has practical implications for the interpretation of the data.},

  Abstract                 = {Inferring causal effects of treatments is a central goal in many disciplines. The potential outcomes framework is a main statistical approach to causal inference, in which a causal effect is defined as a comparison of the potential outcomes of the same units under different treatment conditions. Because for each unit at most one of the potential outcomes is observed and the rest are missing, causal inference is inherently a missing data problem. Indeed, there is a close analogy in the terminology and the inferential framework between causal inference and missing data. Despite the intrinsic connection between the two subjects, statistical analyses of causal inference and missing data also have marked differences in aims, settings and methods. This article provides a systematic review of causal inference from the missing data perspective. Focusing on ignorable treatment assignment mechanisms, we discuss a wide range of causal inference methods that have analogues in missing data analysis, such as imputation, inverse probability weighting and doubly robust methods. Under each of the three modes of inference—Frequentist, Bayesian and Fisherian randomization—we present the general structure of inference for both finite-sample and super-population estimands, and illustrate via specific examples. We identify open questions to motivate more research to bridge the two fields.},

This paper provides both analytic and Monte Carlo evidence regarding the effectiveness of six popular missing data methods for classification trees applied to binary response data. We show that in the context of classification trees, the relationship between the missingness and the dependent variable, as well as the existence or non-existence of missing values in the testing data, are the most helpful criteria to distinguish different missing data methods. In particular, separate class is clearly the best method to use when the testing set has missing values and the missingness is related to the response variable. A real data set related to modeling bankruptcy of a firm is then analyzed. The paper concludes with discussion of adaptation of these results to logistic regression, and other potential generalizations.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of missing data on quantitative research can be serious, leading to biased estimates of parameters, loss of information, decreased statistical power, increased standard errors, and weakened generalizability of findings. In this paper, we discussed and demonstrated three principled missing data methods: multiple imputation, full information maximum likelihood, and expectation-maximization algorithm, applied to a real-world data set. Results were contrasted with those obtained from the complete data set and from the listwise deletion method. The relative merits of each method are noted, along with common features they share. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the importance of statistical assumptions, and recommendations for researchers. Quality of research will be enhanced if (a) researchers explicitly acknowledge missing data problems and the conditions under which they occurred, (b) principled methods are employed to handle missing data, and (c) the appropriate treatment of missing data is incorporated into review standards of manuscripts submitted for publication.},

  year          = {2019},
  abstract      = {Missing data occur in many types of studies and typically complicate the analysis. Multiple imputation, either using joint modelling or the more flexible fully conditional specification approach, are popular and work well in standard settings. In settings involving non-linear associations or interactions, however, incompatibility of the imputation model with the analysis model is an issue often resulting in bias. Similarly, complex outcomes such as longitudinal or survival outcomes cannot be adequately handled by standard implementations. In this paper, we introduce the R package JointAI, which utilizes the Bayesian framework to perform simultaneous analysis and imputation in regression models with incomplete covariates. Using a fully Bayesian joint modelling approach it overcomes the issue of uncongeniality while retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification multiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and imputation models as a sequence of univariate models that can be adapted to the type of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof as well as survival models and joint models for longitudinal and survival data, that take arguments analogous to corresponding well known functions for the analysis of complete data from base R and other packages. Usage and features of JointAI are described and illustrated using various examples and the theoretical background is outlined.},

  year          = {2019},
  abstract      = {We consider the problem of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure -- adaptive Bayesian SLOPE -- which effectively combines the SLOPE method (sorted l1 regularization) together with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO method. We position our approach within a Bayesian framework which allows for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, despite the missing values. As with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO, the coefficients are regarded as arising from a hierarchical model consisting of two groups: (1) the spike for the inactive and (2) the slab for the active. However, instead of assigning independent spike priors for each covariate, here we deploy a joint "SLOPE" spike prior which takes into account the ordering of coefficient magnitudes in order to control for false discoveries. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent a severe trauma, where we show excellent performance in predicting platelet levels. Our methodology has been implemented in C++ and wrapped into an R package ABSLOPE for public use.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the estimation of unknown parameters in a generalized linear model when some covariates have nonignorable missing values. When an instrument, a covariate that helps identifying parameters under nonignorable missingness, is appropriately specified, a pseudo likelihood approach similar to that in Tang, Little and Raghunathan (2003) or Zhao and Shao (2015) can be applied. However, this approach does not work well when the instrument is a weak predictor of the response given other covariates. We show that the asymptotic variances of the pseudo likelihood estimators for the regression coefficients of covariates other than the instrument diverge to infinity as the regression coefficient of the instrument goes to 0. By an imputation-based adjustment for the score equations, we propose a new estimator for the regression coefficients of the covariates other than the instrument. This works well even if the instrument is a weak predictor. It is semiparametric since the propensity of missing covariate data is completely unspecified. To solve the adjusted score equation, we develop an iterative algorithm that can be applied by using standard softwares at each iteration. We establish some theoretical results on the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. A variance estimation formula is also derived. Some simulation results and a data example are presented for illustration.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method of analyzing a series of independent cross-sectional surveys in which some questions are not answered in some surveys and some respondents do not answer some of the questions posed. The method is also applicable to a single survey in which different questions are asked or different sampling methods are used in different strata or clusters. Our method involves multiply imputing the missing items and questions by adding to existing methods of imputation designed for single surveys a hierarchical regression model that allows covariates at the individual and survey levels. Information from survey weights is exploited by including in the analysis the variables on which the weights were based, and then reweighting individual responses (observed and imputed) to estimate population quantities. We also develop diagnostics for checking the fit of the imputation model based on comparing imputed data to nonimputed data. We illustrate with the example that motivated this project: a study of pre-election public opinion polls in which not all the questions of interest are asked in all the surveys, so that it is infeasible to impute within each survey separately.},

  Abstract                 = {In problems with missing or latent data, a standard approach is to first impute the unobserved data, then perform all statistical analyses on the completed dataset -- corresponding to the observed data and imputed unobserved data --  using standard procedures for complete‐data inference. Here, we extend this approach to model checking by demonstrating the advantages of the use of completed‐data model diagnostics on imputed completed datasets. The approach is set in the theoretical framework of Bayesian posterior predictive checks (but, as with missing‐data imputation, our methods of missing‐data model checking can also be interpreted as “predictive inference” in a non‐Bayesian context). We consider the graphical diagnostics within this framework. Advantages of the completed‐data approach include: (1) One can often check model fit in terms of quantities that are of key substantive interest in a natural way, which is not always possible using observed data alone. (2) In problems with missing data, checks may be devised that do not require to model the missingness or inclusion mechanism; the latter is useful for the analysis of ignorable but unknown data collection mechanisms, such as are often assumed in the analysis of sample surveys and observational studies. (3) In many problems with latent data, it is possible to check qualitative features of the model (for example, independence of two variables) that can be naturally formalized with the help of the latent data. We illustrate with several applied examples.},

  Abstract                 = {The notion of coarsening at random (CAR) was introduced by Heitjan and Rubin (1991) to describe the most general form of randomly grouped, censored, or missing data, for which the coarsening mechanism can be ignored when making likelihood-based inference about the parameters of the distribution of the variable of interest. The CAR assumption is popular, and applications abound. However the full implications of the assumption have not been realized. Moreover a satisfactory theory of CAR for continuously distributed data -- which is needed in many applications, particularly in survival analysis -- hardly exists as yet. This paper gives a detailed study of CAR. We show that grouped data from a finite sample space always fit a CAR model: a nonparametric model for the variable of interest together with the assumption of an arbitrary CAR mechanism puts no restriction at all on the distribution of the observed data. In a slogan, CAR is everything. We describe what would seem to be the most general way CAR data could occur in practice, a sequential procedure called randomized monotone coarsening. We show that CAR mechanisms exist which are not of this type. Such a coarsening mechanism uses information about the underlying data which is not revealed to the observer, without this affecting the observer’s conclusions. In a second slogan, CAR is more than it seems. This implies that if the analyst can argue from subject-matter considerations that coarsened data is CAR, he or she has knowledge about the structure of the coarsening mechanism which can be put to good use in non-likelihood-based inference procedures. We argue that this is a valuable option in multivariate survival analysis. We give a new definition of CAR in general sample spaces, criticising earlier proposals, and we establish parallel results to the discrete case. The new definition focusses on the distribution rather than the density of the data. It allows us to generalise the theory of CAR to the important situation where coarsening variables (e.g., censoring times) are partially observed as well as the variables of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers are often faced with the challenge of developing statistical models with incomplete data. Exacerbating this situation is the possibility that either the researcher's complete-data model or the model of the missing-data mechanism is misspecified. In this article, we create a formal theoretical framework for developing statistical models and detecting model misspecification in the presence of incomplete data where maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by maximizing the
observable-data likelihood function when the missing-data mechanism is assumed ignorable. First, we provide sufficient regularity conditions on the researcher's complete-data model to characterize the asymptotic behavior of maximum likelihood estimates in the simultaneous presence of both missing data and model misspecification. These results are then used to derive robust hypothesis testing
methods for possibly misspecified models in the presence of Missing at Random (MAR) or Missing Not at Random (MNAR) missing data. Second, we introduce a method for the detection of model misspecification in missing data problems using recently developed Generalized Information Matrix Tests (GIMT). Third, we identify regularity conditions for the Missing Information Principle (MIP) to hold in the presence of model misspecification so as to provide useful computational covariance matrix estimation formulas. Fourth, we provide regularity conditions that ensure the observable-data expected negative log-likelihood function is convex in the presence of partially observable data when the amount of missingness is sufficiently small and the complete-data likelihood is convex. Fifth, we show that when the researcher has correctly specified a complete-data model with a convex negative likelihood function and an ignorable missing-data mechanism, then its strict local minimizer is the true parameter value for the complete-data model when the amount of missingness is sufficiently small. Our results thus provide new robust estimation, inference, and specification analysis methods for developing statistical models with incomplete data.},

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

Next, they discuss missing categorical data, present the beginnings of a maximum-likelihood approach to analysis with missing categorical data, discuss the use of a multiple imputation procedure for categorical data, and touch on the use of continuous-data methods for analyzing categorical data. The authors then discuss what happens when the assumptions underlying their recommended approach are not met fully with new data being presented relating to the causes of missingness. A general sensitivity analysis for the case in which the assumptions of the recommended missing data procedures are not met fully is presented. Finally, the authors discuss new approaches available to prevention and applied psychological researchers and suggest that prevention studies in general may be relatively free from serious attrition biases (if recommended analyses are used).

We describe a mixture model for the joint distribution which accommodates incomplete repeated measures and right-censored event times, and provide methods for full maximum likelihood estimation. The methods are illustrated through analysis of data from a clinical trial for a new schizophrenia therapy; in the trial, dropout time is closely related to outcome, and the dropout process differs between treatments. The parameter estimates from the model are used to make a treatment comparison after adjusting for the effects of dropout. An added benefit of the analysis is that it permits using the repeated measures to increase efficiency of estimates of the event time distribution.},

  Abstract = {Inferring causal effects from longitudinal repeated measures data has high relevance to a number of areas of research, including economics, social sciences and epidemiology. In observational studies in particular, the treatment receipt mechanism is typically not under the control of the investigator; it can depend on various factors, including the outcome of interest. This results in differential selection into treatment levels, and can lead to selection bias when standard routines such as least squares regression are used to estimate causal effects. Interestingly, both the characterization of and methodology for handling selection bias can differ substantially by disciplinary tradition. In social sciences and economics, instrumental variables (IV) is the standard method for estimating linear and nonlinear models in which the error term may be correlated with an observed covariate. When such correlation is not ruled out, the covariate is called endogenous and least squares estimates of the covariate effect are typically biased. The availability of an instrumental variable can be used to reduce or eliminate the bias.In public health and clinical medicine (e.g., epidemiology and biostatistics), selection bias is typically viewed in terms of confounders, and the prevailing methods are geared toward making proper adjustments via explicit use of observed confounders (e.g., stratification, standardization). A class of methods known as inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators, which relies on modeling selection in terms of confounders, is gaining in popularity for making such adjustments.Our objective is to review and compare IPW and IV for estimating causal treatment effects from longitudinal data, where the treatment may vary with time. We accomplish this by defining the causal estimands in terms of a linear stochastic model of potential outcomes (counterfactuals). Our comparison includes a review of terminology typically used in discussions of causal inference (e.g., confounding, endogeneity); a review of assumptions required to identify causal effects and their implications for estimation and interpretation; description of estimation via inverse weighting and instrumental variables; and a comparative analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV-infected women. In our discussion of assumptions and estimation routines, we try to emphasize sufficient conditions needed to implement relatively standard analyses that can essentially be formulated as regression models. In that sense this review is geared toward the quantitative practitioner.The objective of the data analysis is to estimate the causal (therapeutic) effect of receiving combination antiviral therapy on longitudinal CD4 cell counts, where receipt of therapy varies with time and depends on CD4 count and other covariates. Assumptions are reviewed in context, and resulting inferences are compared. The analysis illustrates the importance of considering the existence of unmeasured confounding and of checking for ‘weak instruments.’ It also suggests that IV methodology may have a role in longitudinal cohort studies where potential instrumental variables are available.},

Unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing cells in their data.

  Abstract                 = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

We use a multinomial model for the missing data indicators and propose a joint distribution for them which can be written as a sequence of one‐dimensional conditional distributions, with each one‐dimensional conditional distribution consisting of a logistic regression. We allow the covariates to be either categorical or continuous. The joint covariate distribution is also modelled via a sequence of one‐dimensional conditional distributions, and the response variable is assumed to be completely observed. We derive the E‐ and M‐steps of the EM algorithm with non‐ignorable missing covariate data. For categorical covariates, we derive a closed form expression for the E‐ and M‐steps of the EM algorithm for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). For continuous covariates, we use a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm to obtain the MLEs via the Gibbs sampler. Computational techniques for Gibbs sampling are proposed and implemented. The parametric form of the assumed missing data mechanism itself is not `testable' from the data, and thus the non‐ignorable modelling considered here can be viewed as a sensitivity analysis concerning a more complicated model. Therefore, although a model may have `passed' the tests for a certain missing data mechanism, this does not mean that we have captured, even approximately, the correct missing data mechanism. Hence, model checking for the missing data mechanism and sensitivity analyses play an important role in this problem and are discussed in detail.

However, it is still a challenging problem: even if the cost of sequencing techniques has decreased over the last years, the number of samples in a given experiment is still (very) small compared to the number of genes. Results: We propose a method to increase the reliability of the inference when RNA-seq expression data have been measured together with an auxiliary dataset that can provide external information on gene expression similarity between samples. Our statistical approach, hd-MI, is based on imputation for samples without available RNA-seq data that are considered as missing data but are observed on the secondary dataset. hd-MI can improve the reliability of the inference for missing rates up to 30% and provides more stable networks with a smaller number of false positive edges. On a biological point of view, hd-MI was also found relevant to infer networks from RNA-seq data acquired in adipose tissue during a nutritional intervention in obese individuals. In these networks, novel links between genes were highlighted, as well as an improved comparability between the two steps of the nutritional intervention.

  Abstract={The issue of missing data in supervised learning has been largely overlooked, especially in the deep learning community. We investigate strategies to adapt neural architectures to handle missing values. Here, we focus on regression and classification problems where the features are assumed to be missing at random. Of particular interest are schemes that allow to reuse as-is a neural discriminative architecture. One scheme involves imputing the missing values with learnable constants. We propose a second novel approach that leverages recent advances in deep generative modelling. More precisely, a deep latent variable model can be learned jointly with the discriminative model, using importance-weighted variational inference in an end-to-end way. This hybrid approach, which mimics multiple imputation, also allows to impute the data, by relying on both the discriminative and the generative model. We also discuss ways of using a pre-trained generative model to train the discriminative one. In domains where powerful deep generative models are available, the hybrid approach leads to large performance gains.},

Specifically, a deep neural network enables us to flexibly model the conditional distribution of the missingness pattern given the data. This allows for incorporating prior information about the type of missingness (e.g. self-censoring) into the model. Our inference technique, based on importance-weighted variational inference, involves maximising a lower bound of the joint likelihood. Stochastic gradients of the bound are obtained by using the reparameterisation trick both in latent space and data space. We show on various kinds of data sets and missingness patterns that explicitly modelling the missing process can be invaluable.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers are often faced with analyzing data sets that are not complete. To prop- erly analyze such data sets requires the knowledge of the missing data mechanism. If data are missing completely at random (MCAR), then many missing data analysis techniques lead to valid inference. Thus, tests of MCAR are desirable. The package MissMech implements two tests developed by Jamshidian and Jalal (2010) for this purpose. These tests can be run using a function called TestMCARNormality. One of the tests is valid if data are normally distributed, and another test does not require any distributional assumptions for the data. In addition to testing MCAR, in some special cases, the function TestMCARNormality is also able to test whether data have a multivariate normal distribution. As a bonus, the functions in MissMech can also be used for the following additional tasks: (i) test of homoscedasticity for several groups when data are completely observed, (ii) perform the k-sample test of Anderson-Darling to determine whether k groups of univariate data come from the same distribution, (iii) impute incomplete data sets using two methods, one where normality is assumed and one where no specific distributional assumptions are made, (iv) obtain normal-theory maximum likelihood estimates for mean and covariance matrix when data are incomplete, along with their standard errors, and finally (v) perform the Neyman's test of uniformity. All of these features are explained in the paper, including examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Test of homogeneity of covariances (or homoscedasticity) among several groups has many applications in statistical analysis. In the context of incomplete data analysis, tests of homoscedasticity among groups of cases with identical missing data patterns have been proposed to test whether data are missing completely at random (MCAR). These tests of MCAR require large sample sizes n and/or large group sample sizes n(i), and they usually fail when applied to non-normal data. Hawkins (1981) proposed a test of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity that is an exact test for complete data when n(i) are small. This paper proposes a modification of this test for complete data to improve its performance, and extends its application to test of homoscedasticity and MCAR when data are multivariate normal and incomplete. Moreover, it is shown that the statistic used in the Hawkins test in conjunction with a nonparametric k-sample test can be used to obtain a nonparametric test of homoscedasticity that works well for both normal and non-normal data. It is explained how a combination of the proposed normal-theory Hawkins test and the nonparametric test can be employed to test for homoscedasticity, MCAR, and multivariate normality. Simulation studies show that the newly proposed tests generally outperform their existing competitors in terms of Type I error rejection rates. Also, a power study of the proposed tests indicates good power. The proposed methods use appropriate missing data imputations to impute missing data. Methods of multiple imputation are described and one of the methods is employed to confirm the result of our single imputation methods. Examples are provided where multiple imputation enables one to identify a group or groups whose covariance matrices differ from the majority of other groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Logistic regression is a common classification method in supervised learning. Sur- prisingly, there are very few solutions for performing it and selecting variables in the presence of missing values. We develop a complete approach, including the es- timation of parameters and variance of estimators, derivation of confidence intervals and a model selection procedure, for cases where the missing values can be anywhere in covariates. By well organizing different patterns of missingness in each observa- tion, we propose a stochastic approximation version of the EM algorithm based on Metropolis-Hasting sampling, to perform statistical inference for logistic regression with incomplete data. We also tackle the problem of prediction for a new individual with missing values, which is never addressed. The methodology is computationally efficient, and its good coverage and variable selection properties are demonstrated in a simulation study where we contrast its performances to other methods. For instance, the popular multiple imputation by chained equation can lead to biased estimates while our method is unbiased. We then illustrate the method on a dataset of severely traumatized patients from Paris hospitals to predict the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock, a leading cause of early preventable death in severe trauma cases. The aim is to consolidate the current red flag procedure, a binary alert identifying patients with a high risk of severe hemorrhage. The methodology is implemented in the R package misaem.},

Hot deck imputation methods are computationally simple, yet effective for creating complete data sets from which correct inferences may be drawn. All hot deck methods draw values for the imputation of missing values from the data matrix that will later be analyzed. The object, from which these available values are taken for imputation within another, is called the donor. This duplication of values may lead to the problem that using any donor ``too often'' will induce incorrect estimates. To mitigate this dilemma some hot deck methods limit the amount of times any one donor may be selected. This study answers which conditions influence whether or not any such limitation is sensible for six different hot deck methods. In addition, five factors that influence the strength of any such advantage are identified and possibilities for further research are discussed.},

Another approach is to stratify the model based on the range of values for an explanatory variable, with a separate stratum for those individuals in which the explanatory variable is missing. For a least squares regression analysis using either of these two missing-data approaches, the exact biases of the estimators for the regression coefficients and the residual variance are derived and reported. The complete-case analysis, in which individuals with any missing data are omitted, is also investigated theoretically and is found to be free of bias in many situations, though often wasteful of information. A numerical evaluation of the bias of two missing-indicator methods and the complete-case analysis is reported. The missing-indicator methods show unacceptably large biases in practical situations and are not advisable in general.},

With missing data, statistical tests will lose power, results may be biased, or analysis may not be feasible at all. There are several ways to handle the problem, for example through imputation. With imputation, missing values are replaced with estimated values according to an imputation method or model. In the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) method, a case is imputed using values from the k most similar cases. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the k-NN method using Likert data in a software engineering context. We simulate the method with different values of k and for different percentages of missing data. Our findings indicate that it is feasible to use the k-NN method with Likert data. We suggest that a suitable value of k is approximately the square root of the number of complete cases. We also show that by relaxing the method rules with respect to selecting neighbours, the ability of the method remains high for large amounts of missing data without affecting the quality of the imputation.},

An abundant literature addresses missing values in an inferential framework, where the aim is to estimate parameters and their variance from incomplete tables. Here, we consider supervised-learning settings where the objective is to best predict a target when missing values appear in both training and test sets. We analyze which missing-values strategies lead to good prediction. We show the consistency of two approaches to estimating the prediction function. The most striking one shows that the widely-used mean imputation prior to learning method is consistent when missing values are not informative. This is in contrast with inferential settings as mean imputation is known to have serious drawbacks in terms of deformation of the joint and marginal distribution of the data. That such a simple approach can be consistent has important consequences in practice. This result holds asymptotically when the learning algorithm is consistent in itself. We contribute additional analysis on decision trees as they can naturally tackle empirical risk minimization with missing values. This is due to their ability to handle the half-discrete nature of variables with missing values. After comparing theoretically and empirically different missing-values strategies in trees, we recommend using the missing incorporated in attributes method as it can handle both non-informative and informative missing values.},

Problems associated with missing values are loss of efficiency, complications in handling and analyzing the data and bias resulting from differences between missing and complete data. The important factor for selection of approach to missing values is missing data mechanism. There are various strategies for dealing with missing values. Some analytical methods have their own approach to handle missing values. Data set reduction is another option. Finally missing values problem can be handled by missing values imputation. This paper presents simple methods for missing values imputation like using most common value, mean or median, closest fit approach and methods based on data mining algorithms like k-nearest neighbor, neural networks and association rules, discusses their usability and presents issues with their applicability on examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Valid causal inference in observational studies often requires controlling for confounders. However, in practice measurements of confounders may be noisy, and can lead to biased estimates of causal effects. We show that we can reduce the bias caused by measurement noise using a large number of noisy measurements of the underlying confounders. We propose the use of matrix factorization to infer the confounders from noisy covariates, a flexible and principled framework that adapts to missing values, accommodates a wide variety of data types, and can augment many causal inference methods. We bound the error for the induced average treatment effect estimator and show it is consistent in a linear regression setting, using Exponential Family Matrix Completion preprocessing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in numerical experiments with both synthetic data and real clinical data.},

  Abstract={Decision trees are a popular family of models due to their attractive properties such as interpretability and ability to handle heterogeneous data. Concurrently, missing data is a prevalent occurrence that hinders performance of machine learning models. As such, handling missing data in decision trees is a well studied problem. In this paper, we tackle this problem by taking a probabilistic approach. At deployment time, we use tractable density estimators to compute the "expected prediction" of our models. At learning time, we fine-tune parameters of already learned trees by minimizing their "expected prediction loss" w.r.t. our density estimators. We provide brief experiments showcasing effectiveness of our methods compared to few baselines.},

In order to use the multivariate normal distribution, implementations of joint MVN MI typically assume that categories of discrete variables are probabilistically constructed from continuous values. We use simulations to examine the implications of these assumptions. For each approach, we assess (1) the accuracy of the imputed values; and (2) the accuracy of coefficients and fitted values from a model fit to completed data sets. These simulations consider continuous, binary, ordinal, and unordered-categorical variables. One set of simulations uses multivariate normal data, and one set uses data from the 2008 American National Election Studies. We implement a less restrictive approach than is typical when evaluating methods using simulations in the missing data literature: in each case, missing values are generated by carefully following the conditions necessary for missingness to be “missing at random” (MAR). We find that in these situations conditional MI is more accurate than joint MVN MI whenever the data include categorical variables.},

When data are missing at random it is possible to incorporate this information into the optimality criterion that is used to find designs; Imhof, Song and Wong (2002) develop such a framework. However, when data are not missing at random this framework can lead to inefficient designs. We investigate and address the specific challenges that not missing at random values present when finding optimal designs for linear regression models. We show that the optimality criteria depend on model parameters that traditionally do not affect the design, such as regression coefficients and the residual variance.

  Abstract={Missing data are ubiquitous in medical research. Although there is increasing guidance on how to handle missing data, practice is changing slowly and misapprehensions abound, particularly in observational research. We present a practical framework for handling and reporting the analysis of incomplete data in observational studies, which we illustrate using a case study from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The framework consists of three steps: 1) Develop an analysis plan specifying the analysis model and how missing data are going to be addressed. An important consideration is whether a complete records analysis is likely to be valid, whether multiple imputation or an alternative approach is likely to offer benefits, and whether a sensitivity analysis regarding the missingness mechanism is required. 2) Explore the data, checking the methods outlined in the analysis plan are appropriate, and conduct the pre-planned analysis. 3) Report the results, including a description of the missing data, details on how the missing data were addressed, and the results from all analyses, interpreted in light of the missing data and the clinical relevance. This framework seeks to support researchers in thinking systematically about missing data, and transparently reporting the potential effect on the study results.},

Six classes of procedures are distinguished: complete case analysis, available case methods, least squares on imputed data, maximum likelihood, Bayesian methods, and multiple imputation. Methods are compared and illustrated when missing data are confined to one independent variable, and extensions to more general patterns are indicated. Attention is paid to the performance of methods when the missing data are not missing completely at random. Least squares methods that fill in missing X's using only data on the X's are contrasted with likelihood-based methods that use data on the X's and Y. The latter approach is preferred and provides methods for elaboration of the basic normal linear regression model. It is suggested that more widely distributed software is needed that advances beyond complete-case analysis, available-case analysis, and naive imputation methods. Bayesian simulation methods and multiple imputation are reviewed; these provide fruitful avenues for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a random sample on variables X1, ..., XV with some values of XV missing. Selection models specify the distribution of X1, ..., XV over respondents and nonrespondents to XV, and the conditional distribution that XV is missing given X1, ..., XV. In contrast, pattern-mixture models specify the conditional distribution of X1, ..., XV given that XV is observed or missing respectively and the marginal distribution of the binary indicator for whether or not XV is missing. For multivariate data with a general pattern of missing values, the literature has tended to adopt the selection-modeling approach (see for example Little and Rubin); here, pattern-mixture models are proposed for this more general problem. Pattern-mixture models are chronically underidentified; in particular for the case of univariate nonresponse mentioned above, there are no data on the distribution of XV given X1, ..., XV-1 in the stratum with XV missing. Thus the models require restrictions or prior information to identify the parameters. Complete-case restrictions tie unidentified parameters to their (identified) analogs in the stratum of complete cases. Alternative types of restriction tie unidentified parameters to parameters in other missing-value patterns or sets of such patterns. This large set of possible identifying restrictions yields a rich class of missing-data models. Unlike ignorable selection models, which generally requires iterative methods except for special missing-data patterns, some pattern-mixture models yield explicit ML estimates for general patterns. Such models are readily amenable to Bayesian methods and form a convenient basis for multiple imputation. Some previously considered noniterative estimation methods are shown to be maximum likelihood (ML) under a pattern-mixture model. For example, Buck's method for continuous data, corrected as in Beale and Little (1975), and Brown's estimators for nonrandomly missing data are ML for pattern-mixture models with particular complete-case restrictions. Available-case analyses, where the mean and variance of Xj are computed using all cases with Xj observed and the correlation (or covariance) of Xj and Xk is computed using all cases with Xj and Xk observed, are also close to ML for another pattern-mixture model. Asymptotic theory for this class of estimators is outlined.},

This article discusses methods that simultaneously model the data and the drop-out process within a unified model-based framework. Models are classified into two broad classes--random-coefficient selection models and random-coefficient pattern-mixture models--depending on how the joint distribution of the data and drop-out mechanism is factored. Inference is likelihood-based, via maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. A number of examples in the literature are placed in this framework, and possible extensions outlined. Data collection on the nature of the drop-out process is advocated to guide the choice of model. In cases where the drop-out mechanism is not well understood, sensitivity analyses are suggested to assess the effect on inferences about target quantities of alternative assumptions about the drop-out process.},

Abstract = {Although the standard formulations of prediction problems involve fully-observed and noiseless data drawn in an i.i.d. manner, many applications involve noisy and/or missing data, possibly involving dependencies. We study these issues in the context of high-dimensional sparse linear regression, and propose novel estimators for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. Many standard approaches to noisy or missing data, such as those using the EM algorithm, lead to optimization problems that are inherently non-convex, and it is difficult to establish theoretical guarantees on practical algorithms. While our approach also involves optimizing non-convex programs, we are able to both analyze the statistical error associated with any global optimum, and prove that a simple projected gradient descent algorithm will converge in polynomial time to a small neighborhood of the set of global minimizers. On the statistical side, we provide non-asymptotic bounds that hold with high probability for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. On the computational side, we prove that under the same types of conditions required for statistical consistency, the projected gradient descent algorithm will converge at geometric rates to a near-global minimizer. We illustrate these theoretical predictions with simulations, showing agreement with the predicted scalings.},

  Abstract                 = {When estimating multiple regression models with incomplete predictor variables, it is necessary to specify a joint distribution for the predictor variables. A convenient assumption is that this distribution is a joint normal distribution, the default in many statistical software packages. This distribution will in general be misspecified if the predictors with missing data have nonlinear effects (e.g., x2) or are included in interaction terms (e.g., x.z). In the present article, we discuss a sequential modeling approach that can be applied to decompose the joint distribution of the variables into 2 parts: (a) a part that is due to the model of interest and (b) a part that is due to the model for the incomplete predictors. We demonstrate how the sequential modeling approach can be used to implement a multiple imputation strategy based on Bayesian estimation techniques that can accommodate rather complex substantive regression models with nonlinear effects and also allows a flexible treatment of auxiliary variables. In 4 simulation studies, we showed that the sequential modeling approach can be applied to estimate nonlinear effects in regression models with missing values on continuous, categorical, or skewed predictor variables under a broad range of conditions and investigated the robustness of the proposed approach against distributional misspecifications. We developed the R package mdmb, which facilitates a user-friendly application of the sequential modeling approach, and we present a real-data example that illustrates the flexibility of the software.},

Abstract = {Matrix completion is often applied to data with entries missing not at random (MNAR). For example, consider a recommendation system where users tend to only reveal ratings for items they like. In this case, a matrix completion method that relies on entries being revealed at uniformly sampled row and column indices can yield overly optimistic predictions of unseen user ratings. Recently, various papers have shown that we can reduce this bias in MNAR matrix completion if we know the probabilities of different matrix entries being missing. These probabilities are typically modeled using logistic regression or naive Bayes, which make strong assumptions and lack guarantees on the accuracy of the estimated probabilities. In this paper, we suggest a simple approach to estimating these probabilities that avoids these shortcomings. Our approach follows from the observation that missingness patterns in real data often exhibit low nuclear norm structure. We can then estimate the missingness probabilities by feeding the (always fully-observed) binary matrix specifying which entries are revealed to an existing nuclear-norm-constrained matrix completion algorithm by Davenport et al. [2014]. Thus, we tackle MNAR matrix completion by solving a different matrix completion problem first that recovers missingness probabilities. We establish finite-sample error bounds for how accurate these probability estimates are and how well these estimates debias standard matrix completion losses for the original matrix to be completed. Our experiments show that the proposed debiasing strategy can improve a variety of existing matrix completion algorithms, and achieves downstream matrix completion accuracy at least as good as logistic regression and naive Bayes debiasing baselines that require additional auxiliary information.},

Compared to the original IWAE, our algorithm does not induce any additional computational overhead due to the missing data. We also develop Monte Carlo techniques for single and multiple imputation using a DLVM trained on an incomplete data set. We illustrate our approach by training a convolutional DLVM on incomplete static binarisations of MNIST. Moreover, on various continuous data sets, we show that MIWAE provides extremely accurate single imputations, and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods.},

They point out the algorithm's shortcomings and explain how these are addressed in the various extensions.Areas of application discussed include: Regression Medical imaging Categorical data analysis Finite mixture analysis Factor analysis Robust statistical modeling Variance-components estimation Survival analysis Repeated-measures designs For theoreticians, practitioners, and graduate students in statistics as well as researchers in the social and physical sciences, The EM Algorithm and Extensions opens the door to the tremendous potential of this remarkably versatile statistical tool.},

In many cases, however, complete-data maximum likelihood estimation is relatively simple when conditional on some function of the parameters being estimated. We introduce a class of generalized EM algorithms, which we call the ECM algorithm, for Expecta-tion/Conditional Maximization (CM), that takes advantage of the simplicity of complete-data conditional maximum likelihood estimation by replacing a complicated M-step of EM with several computationally simpler cM-steps. We show that the ECM algorithm shares all the appealing convergence properties of EM, such as always increasing the likelihood, and present several illustrative examples.},

The statement, ‘The naive approach of ignoring the missing data and using only the observed portion could provide very misleading conclusions’ is nonsense to me (and I think the authors should also recognize it as nonsense in the real world). Similarly, what does it mean, ‘When analyzing such missing data, ...’; if the data are missing, you can't analyze them.
If you find nothing nonsensical in this reviewer's comments, then the current article is worth a few minutes of your time. Statistical analysis has the same inductive nature as detective work: inferring unknowns from whatever one knows and observes, including the evidence that something is missing. Few qualified detectives would ignore suspicious absences in drawing their overall conclusions. Similarly, understanding the complications and consequences of having missing data is essential to reaching statistically meaningful and scientifically defensible conclusions.},

When covariate data are missing not at random, identification is not guaranteed even under fairly restrictive parametric assumptions, a fact that is illustrated with several examples. We propose a general approach to establish identification of parametric and semiparametric models when a covariate is missing not at random. Without auxiliary information about the missingness process, identification of parametric models is strongly dependent on model specification. However, in the presence of a fully observed shadow variable that is correlated with the missing covariate but otherwise independent of the missingness conditional on the covariate, identification is more broadly achievable, including in fairly large semiparametric models. Special consideration is given to the generalized linear models with the missingness process unrestricted. Under such a setting, the outcome model is identified for a number of familiar generalized linear models, and we provide counterexamples when identification fails. For estimation, we describe an inverse probability weighted estimator that incorporates the shadow variable to estimate the propensity score model, and we evaluate its performance via simulations. We further illustrate the shadow variable approach with a data example about home prices in China.},

  Abstract                 = {To model ecosystem functioning for landscape design, analysts would like detailed data about each parcel of land in the landscape. Usually, only information of low resolution is available for the entire area, supplemented by detailed information for a sample of the parcels. These sample data, usually obtained through two-phase sampling, provide initial values of important design elements for dynamic, often nonlinear, models of ecosystem functioning. However, to represent the contribution of the nonsampled portions of the landscape to ecosystem functioning, it would be convenient to be able to operate as if the detailed design information were available for each and every parcel in the analysis. Inference procedures to complete the design information for the unsampled parcels have usually followed the techniques of stratified or regression sampling. These procedures have been developed with regard to their efficiency for estimating population means and totals rather than for their utility to model ecosystem functioning and response to intervention. Stratified sampling or regression estimates therefore do not retain the complex relationships between multivariate design attributes. We present a new multivariate inference procedure for use in such circumstances. In place of estimating design attributes element-by-element in a traditional sense for each first-phase observation, the procedure simply chooses the most similar parcel from the set of parcels with detailed examinations to act as its stand-in. The stand-in is chosen on the basis of a similarity measure that summarizes the multivariate relationships between the set of low resolution indicator attributes and the set of detailed design attributes derived from the second-phase sample. Canonical correlation analysis is used to derive a similarity function for this procedure, which we call "Most Similar Neighbor Inference." We compared most similar neighbor estimates for a multivariate forest inventory to estimates from regression, stratified sampling, and a Swedish National Forest Survey method. The indicator attributes were recorded from stand records, maps, and aerial photographs, while the design attributes were stand yield characteristics derived from on-the-ground inventories. The most similar neighbor estimates have prediction errors that are comparable in magnitude to the traditional estimates for easy-to-predict design attributes. Thus, most similar neighbor inference should be expected to perform almost as well as regression in sampling contexts requiring estimates of population means or totals. More importantly, the most similar neighbor procedure more closely reproduces the covariance structure of the design attributes. Preserving the relationships among design attributes is a vital feature when the purpose of the modeling is to evaluate management options. Furthermore, because most similar neighbor is an exact interpolator, estimates derived from it are consistent in a finite population sense.},

But since the 1990s, there have been important developments in the statistical methodology for handling missing data. Written by renowned statisticians in this area, Handbook of Missing Data Methodology presents many methodological advances and the latest applications of missing data methods in empirical research. Divided into six parts, the handbook begins by establishing notation and terminology. It reviews the general taxonomy of missing data mechanisms and their implications for analysis and offers a historical perspective on early methods for handling missing data. The following three parts cover various inference paradigms when data are missing, including likelihood and Bayesian methods; semi-parametric methods, with particular emphasis on inverse probability weighting; and multiple imputation methods. The next part of the book focuses on a range of approaches that assess the sensitivity of inferences to alternative, routinely non-verifiable assumptions about the missing data process. The final part discusses special topics, such as missing data in clinical trials and sample surveys as well as approaches to model diagnostics in the missing data setting. In each part, an introduction provides useful background material and an overview to set the stage for subsequent chapters. Covering both established and emerging methodologies for missing data, this book sets the scene for future research. It provides the framework for readers to delve into research and practical applications of missing data methods},

We study the seemingly-simple case where the target to predict is a linear function of the fully-observed data and we show that, in the presence of missing values, the optimal predictor may not be linear. In the particular Gaussian case, it can be written as a linear function of multiway interactions between the observed data and the various missing-value indicators. Due to its intrinsic complexity, we study a simple approximation and prove generalization bounds with finite samples, highlighting regimes for which each method performs best. We then show that multilayer perceptrons with ReLU activation functions can be consistent, and can explore good trade-offs between the true model and approximations. Our study highlights the interesting family of models that are beneficial to fit with missing values depending on the amount of data available.},

  Abstract                 = {The presence of missing values makes supervised learning much more challenging. Indeed, previous work has shown that even when the response is a linear function of the complete data, the optimal predictor is a complex function of the observed entries and the missingness indicator. As a result, the computational or sample complexities of consistent approaches depend on the number of missing patterns, which can be exponential in the number of dimensions. In this work, we derive the analytical form of the optimal predictor under a linearity assumption and various missing data mechanisms including Missing at Random (MAR) and self-masking (Missing Not At Random). Based on a Neumann-series approximation of the optimal predictor, we propose a new principled architecture, named NeuMiss networks. Their originality and strength come from the use of a new type of non-linearity: the multiplication by the missingness indicator. We provide an upper bound on the Bayes risk of NeuMiss networks, and show that they have good predictive accuracy with both a number of parameters and a computational complexity independent of the number of missing data patterns. As a result they scale well to problems with many features, and remain statistically efficient for medium-sized samples. Moreover, we show that, contrary to procedures using EM or imputation, they are robust to the missing data mechanism, including difficult MNAR settings such as self-masking.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a nonparametric Bayesian joint model for multivariate continuous and categorical variables, with the intention of developing a flexible engine for multiple imputation of missing values. The model fuses Dirichlet process mixtures of multinomial distributions for categorical variables with Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for continuous variables. We incorporate dependence between the continuous and categorical variables by (1) modeling the means of the normal distributions as component-specific functions of the categorical variables and (2) forming distinct mixture components for the categorical and continuous data with probabilities that are linked via a hierarchical model. This structure allows the model to capture complex dependencies between the categorical and continuous data with minimal tuning by the analyst. We apply the model to impute missing values due to item nonresponse in an evaluation of the redesign of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The goal is to compare estimates from a field test with the new design to estimates from selected individuals from a panel collected under the old design. We show that accounting for the missing data changes some conclusions about the comparability of the distributions in the two datasets. We also perform an extensive repeated sampling simulation using similar data from complete cases in an existing SIPP panel, comparing our proposed model to a default application of multiple imputation by chained equations. Imputations based on the proposed model tend to have better repeated sampling properties than the default application of chained equations in this realistic setting.

  Abstract = {Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for imputing missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms, but relatively little guidance about their efficacy. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, imputation performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting—the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random.},

  Abstract={Missing data has the potential to affect analyses conducted in all fields of scientific study, including healthcare, economics, and the social sciences. Several approaches to unbiased inference in the presence of non-ignorable missingness rely on the specification of the target distribution and its missingness process as a probability distribution that factorizes with respect to a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we address the longstanding question of the characterization of models that are identifiable within this class of missing data distributions. We provide the first completeness result in this field of study -- necessary and sufficient graphical conditions under which, the full data distribution can be recovered from the observed data distribution. We then simultaneously address issues that may arise due to the presence of both missing data and unmeasured confounding, by extending these graphical conditions and proofs of completeness, to settings where some variables are not just missing, but completely unobserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Randomized clinical trials are the primary tool for evaluating new medical interventions. Randomization provides for a fair comparison between treatment and control groups, balancing out, on average, distributions of known and unknown factors among the participants. Unfortunately, these studies often lack a substantial percentage of data. This missing data reduces the benefit provided by the randomization and introduces potential biases in the comparison of the treatment groups. Missing data can arise for a variety of reasons, including the inability or unwillingness of participants to meet appointments for evaluation. And in some studies, some or all of data collection ceases when participants discontinue study treatment. Existing guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials, and the analysis of the resulting data, provide only limited advice on how to handle missing data. Thus, approaches to the analysis of data with an appreciable amount of missing values tend to be ad hoc and variable. The Prevention and Treatment of Missing Data in Clinical Trials concludes that a more principled approach to design and analysis in the presence of missing data is both needed and possible. Such an approach needs to focus on two critical elements: (1) careful design and conduct to limit the amount and impact of missing data and (2) analysis that makes full use of information on all randomized participants and is based on careful attention to the assumptions about the nature of the missing data underlying estimates of treatment effects. In addition to the highest priority recommendations, the book offers more detailed recommendations on the conduct of clinical trials and techniques for analysis of trial data.},

  Abstract={As a paradigm to recover unknown entries of a matrix from partial observations, low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has generated a great deal of interest. Over the years, there have been lots of works on this topic, but it might not be easy to grasp the essential knowledge from these studies. This is mainly because many of these works are highly theoretical or a proposal of new LRMC technique. In this paper, we give a contemporary survey on LRMC. In order to provide a better view, insight, and understanding of potentials and limitations of the LRMC, we present early scattered results in a structured and accessible way. Specifically, we classify the state-of-the-art LRMC techniques into two main categories and then explain each category in detail. We next discuss the issues to be considered when one considers using the LRMC techniques. These include intrinsic properties required for the matrix recovery and how to exploit a special structure in the LRMC design. We also discuss the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based LRMC algorithms exploiting the graph structure of a low-rank matrix. Furthermore, we present the recovery performance and the computational complexity of state-of-the-art LRMC techniques. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a useful guide for practitioners and non-experts to catch the gist of the LRMC.},

In the extreme case, the answer can be indefinite contrary to a confabulation specific for the aforementioned methods.

A weighted estimating equations approach gives consistent estimation under MAR when the drop-out mechanism is correctly specified. In this approach, observations or person-visits are weighted inversely proportional to their probability of being observed. Using a simulation study, we compare the performance of unweighted and weighted GEE in models for time-specific means of a repeated binary response with MAR drop-outs. Weighted GEE resulted in smaller finite sample bias than GEE. However, when the drop-out model was misspecified, weighted GEE sometimes performed worse than GEE. Weighted GEE with observation-level weights gave more efficient estimates than a weighted GEE procedure with cluster-level weights.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical and social research, and multiple imputation
(MI) is increasingly the methodology of choice for practitioners. Two principal strategies for imputation have been proposed in the literature: joint modelling multiple
imputation (JM-MI) and full conditional specification multiple imputation (FCS-MI).
While JM-MI is arguably a preferable approach, because it involves specification of an
explicit imputation model, FCS-MI is pragmatically appealing, because of its flexibility in handling different types of variables. JM-MI has developed from the multivariate normal model, and latent normal variables have been proposed as a natural way to
extend this model to handle categorical variables. In this article, we evaluate the latent
normal model through an extensive simulation study and an application on data from
the German Breast Cancer Study Group, comparing the results with FCS-MI. We
divide our investigation in four sections, focusing on (i) binary, (ii) categorical, (iii)
ordinal, and (iv) count data. Using data simulated from both the latent normal model
and the general location model, we find that in all but one extreme general location
model setting JM-MI works very well, and sometimes outperforms FCS-MI. We conclude the latent normal model, implemented in the R package jomo, can be used with
confidence by researchers, both for single and multilevel multiple imputation.},

The techniques use decision trees and forests to identify horizontal segments of a data set where the records belonging to a segment have higher similarity and attribute correlations. Using the similarity and correlations, missing values are then imputed. To achieve a higher quality of imputation some segments are merged together using a novel approach. We use nine publicly available data sets to experimentally compare our techniques with a few existing ones in terms of four commonly used evaluation criteria. The experimental results indicate a clear superiority of our techniques based on statistical analyses such as confidence interval.},

It is also a common practice to treat the imputed values as if they are true values, and then compute the variance estimates using standard formulae. This procedure, however, could lead to serious underestimation of the true variance, when the proportion of missing values for an item is appreciable. We propose a jackknife variance estimator for stratified multistage surveys which is obtained by first adjusting the imputed values for each pseudo-replicate and then applying the standard jackknife formula. The proposed jack-knife variance estimator is shown to be consistent as the sample size increases, assuming equal response probabilities within imputation classes and using a particular hot deck imputation.},

  Abstract                 = {Hot-deck imputation is an intuitively simple and popular method of accommodating incomplete data. Users of the method will often use the usual multiple imputation variance estimator which is not appropriate in this case. However, no variance expression has yet been derived for this easily implemented method applied to missing covariates in regression models. The simple hot-deck method is in fact asymptotically equivalent to the mean-score method for the estimation of a regression model parameter, so that hot-deck can be understood in the context of likelihood methods. Both of these methods accommodate data where missingness may depend on the observed variables but not on the unobserved value of the incomplete covariate, that is, missing at random (MAR). The asymptotic properties of hot-deck are derived here for the case where the fully observed variables are categorical, though the incomplete covariate(s) may be continuous. Simulation studies indicate that the two methods compare well in small samples and for small numbers of imputations. Current users of hot-deck may now conduct their analysis using mean-score, which is a weighted likelihood method and can thus be implemented by a single pass through the data using any standard package which accommodates weighted regression models. Valid inference is now straightforward using the variance expression provided here. The equivalence of mean-score and hot-deck is illustrated using three clinical data sets where an important covariate is missing for a large number of study subjects.},

Random Forests have become very popular, e.g., in the fields of genetics and bioinformatics, because they can deal with high-dimensional problems including complex interaction effects. Conditional Inference Forests provide an implementation of Random Forests with unbiased variable selection. Like the original Random Forests, they employ surrogate variables to handle missing values in the predictor variables. In this paper we report the results of an extensive simulation study covering both classification and regression problems under a variety of scenarios, including different missing value generating processes as well as different correlation structures between the variables. Moreover, a high dimensional setting with a high number of noise variables was considered in each case. The results compare the performance of Conditional Inference Forests with surrogate variables to that of knn imputation prior to fitting. The results show that while in some settings one or the other approach is slightly superior, there is no overall difference in the performance of Conditional Inference Forests with surrogate variables and with prior knn-imputation.},

  Abstract={Taking advantage of the ability of modern missing data treatments in epidemiological research (e.g. multiple imputation) to recover power while avoiding bias in the presence of data that is missing completely at random, planned missing data designs allow researchers to deliberately incorporate missing data into a research design. A planned missing data design may be done by randomly assigning participants to have missing items in a questionnaire (multiform design) or missing occasions of measurement in a longitudinal study (wave-missing design), or by administering an expensive gold-standard measure to a random subset of participants while the whole sample is administered a cheaper measure (two-method design). Although not common in epidemiology, these designs have been recommended for decades by methodologists for their benefits--notably that data collection costs are minimized and participant burden is reduced, which can increase validity. This paper describes the multiform, wave-missing and two-method designs, including their benefits, their impact on bias and power, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when implementing them in an epidemiological study design.},

	Abstract = {A mixed data frame (MDF) is a table collecting categorical, numerical, and count observations. The use of MDF is widespread in statistics and the applications are numerous from abundance data in ecology to recommender systems. In many cases, an MDF exhibits simultaneously main effects, such as row, column, or group effects and interactions, for which a low-rank model has often been suggested. Although the literature on low-rank approximations is very substantial, with few exceptions, existing methods do not allow to incorporate main effects and interactions while providing statistical guarantees. The present work fills this gap. We propose an estimation method which allows to recover simultaneously the main effects and the interactions. We show that our method is near optimal under conditions which are met in our targeted applications. We also propose an optimization algorithm which provably converges to an optimal solution. Numerical experiments reveal that our method, mimi, performs well when the main effects are sparse and the interaction matrix has low-rank. We also show that mimi compares favorably to existing methods, in particular when the main effects are significantly large compared to the interactions, and when the proportion of missing entries is large. The method is available as an R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In this article we propose a new class of semiparametric estimators, based on inverse probability weighted estimating equations, that are consistent for parameter vector α0 of the conditional mean model when the data are missing at random in the sense of Rubin and the missingness probabilities are either known or can be parametrically modeled. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model by first showing that our estimation problem is a special case of the general problem of parameter estimation in an arbitrary semiparametric model in which the data are missing at random and the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from 0, and then deriving a representation for the efficient score, the semiparametric variance bound, and the influence function of any regular, asymptotically linear estimator in this more general estimation problem. Because the optimal estimator depends on the unknown probability law generating the data, we propose locally and globally adaptive semiparametric efficient estimators. We compare estimators in our class with previously proposed estimators. We show that each previous estimator is asymptotically equivalent to some, usually inefficient, estimator in our class. This equivalence is a consequence of a proposition stating that every regular asymptotic linear estimator of α0 is asymptotically equivalent to some estimator in our class. We compare various estimators in a small simulation study and offer some practical recommendations.},

These estimators can be used to correct for dependent censoring and nonrandom noncompliance in randomized clinical trials studying the effect of a treatment on the evolution over time of the mean of a response variable. The likelihood-based parametric G-computation algorithm estimator may also be used to attempt to correct for dependent censoring and nonrandom noncompliance. But because of possible model misspecification, the parametric G-computation algorithm estimator, in contrast with the proposed weighted estimators, may be inconsistent for the difference in treatment-arm-specific means, even when compliance is completely at random and censoring is independent. We illustrate our methods with the analysis of the effect of zidovudine (AZT) treatment on the evolution of mean CD4 count with data from an AIDS clinical trial.},

We propose a class of augmented inverse probability of response weighted estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) for estimating beta* when the response probabilities can be parametrically modeled and a CAN estimator exists. The proposed estimators do not require full specification of a parametric likelihood, and their computation does not require numerical integration. Our estimators can be viewed as an extension of generalized estimating equation estimators that allows for nonignorable nonresponse. We show that our class essentially consists of all CAN estimators of beta*. We also show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model. When the model for nonresponse is richly parameterized, joint estimation of the regression parameter beta* and the nonresponse model parameter tau* which encodes the magnitude of nonignorable selection bias, may be difficult or impossible. Therefore we propose regarding the selection bias parameter tau* as known, rather than estimating it from the data. We then perform a sensitivity analysis that examines how inference concerning the regression parameter beta* changes as we vary tau* over a range of plausible values. We apply our approach to the analysis of ACTG Trial 002, an AIDS clinical trial.},

For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results.

  Abstract                 = {Multiple imputation is a statistical technique designed to take advantage of the flexibility in modem computing to handle missing data. With it, each missing value is replaced by two or more imputed values in order to represent the uncertainty about whch value to impute. The ideas for multiple imputation first arose in the early 1970s when I was working on a problem of survey nonresponse at Educational Testing Service, here summarized as Example 1.1. T h s work was published several years later as Rubin (1977a). The real impetus for multiple imputation, however, came from work encouraged and supported by Fritz Scheuren, then of the United States Social Security Administration and now head of the Statistics of Income Division at the United States Internal Revenue Service. His concern for problems of nonresponse in the Current Population Survey led to a working paper for the Social Security Administration (Rubin, 1977b), which explicitly proposed multiple imputation. Fritz’s continued support and encouragement for the idea of multiple imputation resulted in (1) an American Statistical Association invited address on multiple imputation (Rubin, 1978a); (2) continued research, such as published in Rubin (1979a); (3) joint work with Fritz and Thomas N. Herzog in the late 1970s, summarized in several papers including Herzog and Rubin (1983); and (4) application of the ideas in 1980 to file matching, which eventually was published as Rubin (1986). Another important contributor to the development of multiple imputation has been the United States Census Bureau, which several years ago supported the production of a monograph on multiple imputation (Rubin, 1980a). This monograph was the first of four nearly complete drafts that were supposed to become this book.},

Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, making these missing-data tools accessible to a broad audience. It presents a unified, Bayesian approach to the analysis of incomplete multivariate data, covering datasets in which the variables are continuous, categorical, or both. The focus is applied, where necessary, to help readers thoroughly understand the statistical properties of those methods, and the behavior of the accompanying algorithms. All techniques are illustrated with real data examples, with extended discussion and practical advice.

Until recently, the only missing-data methods available to most data analysts have been relatively ad1 hoc practices such as listwise deletion. Recent dramatic advances in theoretical and computational statistics, however, have produced anew generation of flexible procedures with a sound statistical basis. These procedures involve multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), a simulation technique that replaces each missing datum with a set of m > 1 plausible values. The rn versions of the complete data are analyzed by standard complete-data methods, and the results are combined using simple rules to yield estimates, standard errors, and p-values that formally incorporate missing-data uncertainty. New computational algorithms and software described in a recent book (Schafer, 1997a) allow us to create proper multiple imputations in complex multivariate settings. This article reviews the key ideas of multiple imputation, discusses the software programs currently available, and demonstrates their use on data from the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial (Hansen & Graham, 199 I).},

We argue that there are two different ways to formalize the notion that only part of the missingness is ignorable. These approaches correspond to assumptions that we call partially missing at random and latently missing at random.

  Abstract = {The concept of missing at random is central in the literature on statistical analysis with missing data. In general, inference using incomplete data should be based not only on observed data values but should also take account of the pattern of missing values. However, it is often said that if data are missing at random, valid inference using likelihood approaches (including Bayesian) can be obtained ignoring the missingness mechanism. Unfortunately, the term "missing at random" has been used inconsistently and not always clearly; there has also been a lack of clarity around the meaning of "valid inference using likelihood". These issues have created potential for confusion about the exact conditions under which the missingness mechanism can be ignored, and perhaps fed confusion around the meaning of "analysis ignoring the missingness mechanism". Here we provide standardised precise definitions of "missing at random" and "missing completely at random", in order to promote unification of the theory. Using these definitions we clarify the conditions that suffice for "valid inference" to be obtained under a variety of inferential paradigms.},

  Abstract                 = {Most methods for handling incomplete data can be broadly classified as inverse probability weighting (IPW) strategies or imputation strategies. The former model the occurrence of incomplete data; the latter, the distribution of the missing variables given observed variables in each missingness pattern. Imputation strategies are typically more efficient, but they can involve extrapolation, which is difficult to diagnose and can lead to large bias. Double robust (DR) methods combine the two approaches. They are typically more efficient than IPW and more robust to model misspecification than imputation. We give a formal introduction to DR estimation of the mean of a partially observed variable, before moving to more general incomplete-data scenarios. We review strategies to improve the performance of DR estimators under model misspecification, reveal connections between DR estimators for incomplete data and ‘design-consistent’ estimators used in sample surveys, and explain the value of double robustness when using flexible data-adaptive methods for IPW or imputation.},

  Abstract                 = {The simplest approach to dealing with missing data is to restrict the analysis to complete cases, i.e. individuals with no missing values. This can induce bias, however. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a commonly used method to correct this bias. It is also used to adjust for unequal sampling fractions in sample surveys. This article is a review of the use of IPW in epidemiological research. We describe how the bias in the complete-case analysis arises and how IPW can remove it. IPW is compared with multiple imputation (MI) and we explain why, despite MI generally being more efficient, IPW may sometimes be preferred. We discuss the choice of missingness model and methods such as weight truncation, weight stabilisation and augmented IPW. The use of IPW is illustrated on data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort},

However, a drawback of this type of neural network is that it requires a full set of input data, and real world data is seldom complete. We have investigated two ways of dealing with incomplete data — network reduction using multiple neural network classifiers, and value substitution using estimated values from predictor networks — and compared their performance with an induction method. On a thyroid disease database collected in a clinical situation, we found that the network reduction method was superior. We conclude that network reduction can be a useful method for dealing with missing values in diagnostic systems based on backpropagation neural networks.},

We derive limits for the values of the least squares estimates of the coefficients (and their associated t statistics) when there are missing observations in one carrier. These limits are derived subject to a constraint on the relationship of the missing data to the present data. Calculating these limits while varying this constrained value results in a series of diagnostic plots that can be used to study the potential effect of the missing points on the regression (without assuming that the points are MAR). Simulations are performed to illustrate the use of the plots, and two real data sets are analyzed. The more general case of missing data in more than one carrier is also discussed.},

Gaussian Mixture Model is used to model the data distribution which is adapted to handle missing values, while Extreme Learning Machine enables to devise a multiple imputation strategy for final estimation. With multiple imputation and ensemble approach over many Extreme Learning Machines, final estimation is improved over the mean imputation performed only once to complete the data.

However, existing methods do not consider the case of informative missing values which are widely encountered in practice. This paper proposes matrix completion methods to recover Missing Not At Random (MNAR) data. Our first contribution is to suggest a model-based estimation strategy by modelling the missing mechanism distribution. An EM algorithm is then implemented, involving a Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). Our second contribution is to suggest a computationally efficient surrogate estimation by implicitly taking into account the joint distribution of the data and the missing mechanism: the data matrix is concatenated with the mask coding for the missing values ; a low-rank structure for exponential family is assumed on this new matrix, in order to encode links between variables and missing mechanisms. The methodology that has the great advantage of handling different missing value mechanisms is robust to model specification errors.},

Methodologies to handle MNAR values also focus on simple settings assuming that only one variable (such as the outcome one) has missing entries. Recent work of Mohan and Pearl based on graphical models and causality show that specific settings of MNAR enable to recover some aspects of the distribution without specifying the MNAR mechanism. We pursue this line of research. Considering a data matrix generated from a probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) model containing several MNAR variables, not necessarily under the same self-masked missing mechanism, we propose estimators for the means, variances and covariances of the variables and study their consistency. The estimators present the great advantage of being computed by only using observed data. In addition, we propose an imputation method of the data matrix and an estimation of the PPCA loading matrix. We compare our proposal with results obtained for ignorable missing values based on the use of expectation-maximization algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Imputation is applied for two quite different purposes: to supply missing data to complete a data set for subsequent modeling analyses or to estimate subpopulation totals. Error properties of the imputed values have different effects in these two contexts. We partition errors of imputation derived from similar observation units as arising from three sources: observation error, the distribution of observation units with respect to their similarity, and pure error given a particular choice of variables known for all observation units. Two new statistics based on this partitioning measure the accuracy of the imputations, facilitating comparison of imputation to alternative methods of estimation such as regression and comparison of alternative methods of imputation generally. Knowing the relative magnitude of the errors arising from these partitions can also guide efficient investment in obtaining additional data. We illustrate this partitioning using three extensive data sets from western North America. Application of this partitioning to compare near-neighbor imputation is illustrated for Mahalanobis- and two canonical correlation-based measures of similarity.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10{\%} to 30{\%}. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.},

However, all standard algorithms suffer from a major problem: variable selection based on standard impurity measures as the Gini Index is biased. The bias is such that, e.g., splitting variables with a high amount of missing values—even if missing completely at random (MCAR)—are artificially preferred. A new split selection criterion that avoids variable selection bias is introduced. The exact distribution of the maximally selected Gini gain is derived by means of a combinatorial approach and the resulting
-value is suggested as an unbiased split selection criterion in recursive partitioning algorithms. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in simulation studies and a real data study from veterinary gynecology in the context of binary classification and continuous predictor variables with different numbers of missing values. The proposed method is extendible to categorical and ordinal predictor variables and to other split selection criteria such as the cross-entropy.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple imputation is an effective method for dealing with missing data, and it is becoming increasingly common in many fields. However, the method is still relatively rarely used in epidemiology, perhaps in part because relatively few studies have looked at practical questions about how to implement multiple imputation in large data sets used for diverse purposes. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on the practicalities and diagnostics for multiple imputation in large data sets. It primarily discusses the method of multiple imputation by chained equations, which iterates through the data, imputing one variable at a time conditional on the others. Illustrative data were derived from 9,186 youths participating in the national evaluation of the Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program, a US federally funded program designed to develop and enhance community-based systems of care to meet the needs of children with serious emotional disturbances and their families. Multiple imputation was used to ensure that data analysis samples reflect the full population of youth participating in this program. This case study provides an illustration to assist researchers in implementing multiple imputation in their own data.},

The analysis of this data set is challenging due to several difficulties, namely, nonignorable missing longitudinal responses and baseline covariates. Hence, we propose a selection model for estimating parameters in the normal random effects model with nonignorable missing responses and covariates. Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood using the Gibbs sampler and a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Standard errors are calculated using the bootstrap. The method allows for nonmonotone patterns of missing data in both the response variable and the covariates. We model the missing data mechanism and the missing covariate distribution via a sequence of one‐dimensional conditional distributions, allowing the missing covariates to be either categorical or continuous, as well as time‐varying. We apply the proposed approach to the ECOG quality‐of‐life data and conduct a small simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood estimates. Our results indicate that a patient treated with the vaccine has a higher QOL score on average at a given time point than a patient treated with high‐dose interferon.},

Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood using the Gibbs sampler and a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The second model is a marginal model for correlated binary responses and discrete covariates with finite range, both of which may be nonignorably missing. We incorporate the missing data mechanism and the missing covariate distribution into the multivariate probit model defined by Chib and Greenberg (1998). We use the EM by method of weights (Ibrahim, 1990) and sample the latent normal variables conditional on a particular response and covariate pattern. The M-steps for each model are like a complete data maximization problem, and standard methods are used. Standard errors for the parameter estimates are computed using the multiple imputation method of Goetghebeur and Ryan (2000). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model and give some guidance as to when one model might be chosen over the other.

  Abstract                 = {The idea of data augmentation arises naturally in missing value problems, as exemplified by the standard ways of filling in missing cells in balanced two-way tables. Thus data augmentation refers to a scheme of augmenting the observed data so as to make it more easy to analyze. This device is used to great advantage by the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) in solving maximum likelihood problems. In situations when the likelihood cannot be approximated closely by the normal likelihood, maximum likelihood estimates and the associated standard errors cannot be relied upon to make valid inferential statements. From the Bayesian point of view, one must now calculate the posterior distribution of parameters of interest. If data augmentation can be used in the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimate, then in the same cases one ought to be able to use it in the computation of the posterior distribution. It is the purpose of this article to explain how this can be done. The basic idea is quite simple. The observed data y is augmented by the quantity z, which is referred to as the latent data. It is assumed that if y and z are both known, then the problem is straightforward to analyze, that is, the augmented data posterior p(theta | y, z) can be calculated. But the posterior density that we want is p(theta | y), which may be difficult to calculate directly. If, however, one can generate multiple values of z from the predictive distribution p(z | y) (i.e., multiple imputations of z), then p(theta | y) can be approximately obtained as the average of p(theta | y, z) over the imputed z's. However, p(z | y) depends, in turn, on p(theta | y). Hence if p(theta | y) was known, it could be used to calculate p(z | y). This mutual dependency between p(theta | y) and p(z | y) leads to an iterative algorithm to calculate p(theta | y). Analytically, this algorithm is essentially the method of successive substitution for solving an operator fixed point equation. We exploit this fact to prove convergence under mild regularity conditions. Typically, to implement the algorithm, one must be able to sample from two distributions, namely p(theta | y, z) and p(z | theta, y). In many cases, it is straightforward to sample from either distribution. In general, though, either sampling can be difficult, just as either the E or the M step can be difficult to implement in the EM algorithm. For p(theta | y, z) arising from parametric submodels of the multinomial, we develop a primitive but generally applicable way to approximately sample theta. The idea is first to sample from the posterior distribution of the cell probabilities and then to project to the parametric surface that is specified by the submodel, giving more weight to those observations lying closer to the surface. This procedure should cover many of the common models for categorical data. There are several examples given in this article. First, the algorithm is introduced and motivated in the context of a genetic linkage example. Second, we apply this algorithm to an example of inference from incomplete data regarding the correlation coefficient of the bivariate normal distribution. It is seen that the algorithm recovers the bimodal nature of the posterior distribution. Finally, the algorithm is used in the analysis of the traditional latent-class model as applied to data from the General Social Survey.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonmonotone missing data arise routinely in empirical studies of the social and health sciences and, when ignored, can induce selection bias and loss of efficiency. It is common to account for nonresponse under a missing-at-random assumption which, although convenient, is rarely appropriate when nonresponse is nonmonotone. Likelihood and Bayesian missing data methodologies often require specification of a parametric model for the full data law, thus a priori ruling out any prospect for semiparametric inference. In this paper, we propose an all-purpose approach which delivers semiparametric inferences when missing data are nonmonotone and not at random. The approach is based on a discrete choice model (DCM) as a means to generate a large class of nonmonotone nonresponse mechanisms that are nonignorable. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, and a general framework for fully parametric and semiparametric inference under an arbitrary DCM is proposed. Special consideration is given to the case of logit discrete choice nonresponse model (LDCM) for which we describe generalizations of inverse-probability weighting, pattern-mixture estimation, doubly robust estimation, and multiply robust estimation.},

Setting Data taken from employees at 3 different industrial sites in Australia. Participants 7915 observations were included. Materials and methods The approach was evaluated using an occupational health data set comprising results of questionnaires, medical tests and environmental monitoring. Statistical methods included standard statistical tests and the 'rpart' and 'gbm' packages for CART and BRT analyses, respectively, from the statistical software 'R'. A simulation study was conducted to explore the capability of decision tree models in describing data with missingness artificially introduced. Results CART and BRT models were effective in highlighting a missingness structure in the data, related to the type of data (medical or environmental), the site in which it was collected, the number of visits, and the presence of extreme values. The simulation study revealed that CART models were able to identify variables and values responsible for inducing missingness. There was greater variation in variable importance for unstructured as compared to structured missingness. Discussion Both CART and BRT models were effective in describing structural missingness in data. CART models may be preferred over BRT models for exploratory analysis of missing data, and selecting variables important for predicting missingness. BRT models can show how values of other variables influence missingness, which may prove useful for researchers. Conclusions Researchers are encouraged to use CART and BRT models to explore and understand missing data.},

  Abstract                 = {Affordable sensors lead to an increasing interest in acquiring and modeling data with multiple modalities. Learning from multiple modalities has shown to significantly improve performance in object recognition. However, in practice it is common that the sensing equipment experiences unforeseeable malfunction or configuration issues, leading to corrupted data with missing modalities. Most existing multi-modal learning algorithms could not handle missing modalities, and would discard either all modalities with missing values or all corrupted data. To leverage the valuable information in the corrupted data, we propose to impute the missing data by leveraging the relatedness among different modalities. Specifically, we propose a novel Cascaded Residual Autoencoder (CRA) to impute missing modalities. By stacking residual autoencoders, CRA grows iteratively to model the residual between the current prediction and original data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CRA on both the data imputation and the object recognition task on imputed data.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1-20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.

We show through a substantial data-based study of classification accuracy that MIA exhibits consistently good performance across a broad range of data types and of sources and amounts of missingness. It is competitive with the best of the rest (particularly, a multiple imputation EM algorithm method; EMMI) while being conceptually and computationally simpler. A simple combination of MIA and EMMI is slower but even more accurate.},

  Abstract                 = {Since it came up in the 1960s, the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) has become widely accepted for the analysis of controlled clinical trials. In this context the question of how to perform such an analysis in the presence of missing information about the main endpoint is of major importance. Uncritical use of several ad hoc strategies for dealing with missing values is common in the practice of clinical trials. On the other hand, little is known about possible dangers and problems of applying these strategies. We therefore performed a detailed investigation of different methods for dealing with missing values in order to develop recommendations for their practical use. A simulation study was performed investigating possible consequences on type I error and power of applying different methods for dealing with missing values. The simulations were based on a clinical trial of osteoporosis, a progressively deteriorating disease. The strategies examined can be roughly classified into numerical imputation strategies (last observation carried forward, mean and regression based methods) and non-parametric strategies (rank and dichotomization based methods). Different drop-out mechanisms and different types of progression of disease are considered. The type I error increases drastically for the different strategies, especially if the courses of disease vary between treatment groups. The loss in power can be substantial. There is no strategy which is adequate for all different combinations of drop-out mechanisms, drop-out rates and courses of disease over time. For drop-out rates less than 20 per cent and similar courses of disease in the treatment groups, missing values might be replaced by the mean of the other group, or counted as treatment failures after dichotomization of the endpoint. For larger drop-out rates or less similar courses of disease, no adequate recommendations can be given. Because of the drastic consequences of increasing drop-out rates, it has to be a primary goal in clinical trials to keep missing values to a minimum. Unobserved information cannot be reliably regained by any methodological resources. As there are no strategies for universal use, reasons for the choice of a certain method have to be provided when designing and analysing clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem. This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader’s intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new class of models for making inference about the mean of a vector of repeated outcomes when the outcome vector is incompletely observed in some study units and missingness is nonmonotone. Each model in our class is indexed by a set of unidentified selection-bias functions which quantify the residual association of the outcome at each occasion t and the probability that this outcome is missing after adjusting for variables observed prior to time t and for the past nonresponse pattern. In particular, selection-bias functions equal to zero encode the investigator's a priori belief that nonresponse of the next outcome does not depend on that outcome after adjusting for the observed past. We call this assumption sequential explainability. Since each model in our class is nonparametric, it fits the data perfectly well. As such, our models are ideal for conducting sensitivity analyses aimed at evaluating the impact that different degrees of departure from sequential explainability have on inference about the marginal means of interest. Although the marginal means are identified under each of our models, their estimation is not feasible in practice because it requires the auxiliary estimation of conditional expectations and probabilities given high-dimensional variables. We henceforth discuss the estimation of the marginal means under each model in our class assuming, additionally, that at each occasion either one of the following two models holds: a parametric model for the conditional probability of nonresponse given current outcomes and past recorded data or a parametric model for the conditional mean of the outcome on the nonrespondents given the past recorded data. We call the resulting procedure 2^T-multiply robust as it protects at each of the T time points against misspecification of one of these two working models, although not against simultaneous misspecification of both. We extend our proposed class of models and estimators to incorporate data configurations which include baseline covariates and a parametric model for the conditional mean of the vector of repeated outcomes given the baseline covariates.},

  Abstract                 = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established dimensionality reduction method commonly used to denoise and visualise data. A classical PCA model is the fixed effect model in which data are generated as a fixed structure of low rank corrupted by noise. Under this model, PCA does not provide the best recovery of the underlying signal in terms of mean squared error. Following the same principle as in ridge regression, we suggest a regularised version of PCA that essentially selects a certain number of dimensions and shrinks the corresponding singular values. Each singular value is multiplied by a term which can be seen as the ratio of the signal variance over the total variance of the associated dimension. The regularised term is analytically derived using asymptotic results and can also be justified from a Bayesian treatment of the model. Regularised PCA provides promising results in terms of the recovery of the true signal and the graphical outputs in comparison with classical PCA and with a soft thresholding estimation strategy. The distinction between PCA and regularised PCA becomes especially important in the case of very noisy data.},

The original enthusiasm was followed by skepticism about the strong but untestable assumptions on which this type of model invariably rests. Since then, the view has emerged that these models should ideally be made part of a sensitivity analysis. This paper presents a formal and flexible approach to such a sensitivity assessment based on local influence (Cook, 1986, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B48, 133-169). The influence of perturbing a missing-at-random dropout model in the direction of nonrandom dropout is explored.

We assume a single outcome analysed under a generalised linear model. One or more sensitivity parameters, specified by the user, measure the degree of departure from missing at random in a pattern mixture model. Advantages of our method are that its sensitivity parameters are relatively easy to interpret and so can be elicited from subject matter experts; it is fast and non-stochastic; and its point estimate, standard error and confidence interval agree perfectly with standard methods when particular values of the sensitivity parameters make those standard methods appropriate. We illustrate the method using data from a mental health trial.},

Under a linear random effects model, when all individuals have complete observations at identical time points, these statistics are maximum likelihood estimates for the expected rates of change. However, with censored or missing data, these estimates are no longer efficient when compared to generalized least squares estimates. When, in addition, the right-censoring process is dependent on the individual rates of change (i.e., informative right censoring), the generalized least squares estimates will be biased. Likelihood-ratio tests for informativeness of the censoring process and maximum likelihood estimates for the expected rates of change and the parameters of the right-censoring process are developed under a linear random effects model with a probit model for the right-censoring process. In realistic situations, we illustrate that the bias in estimating group rate of change and the reduction of power in comparing group differences could be substantial when strong dependency of the right-censoring process on individual rates of change is ignored.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-life data are almost never really real. By the time the data arrive at an investigator’s desk or disk, the raw data, however defined, have most likely gone through at least one “cleaning” process, such as standardization, re-calibration, imputation, or de-sensitization. Dealing with such a reality scientifically requires a more holistic multi-phase perspective than is permitted by the usual framework of “God’s model versus my model.” This article provides an in-depth look, from this broader perspective, into multiple-imputation (MI) inference (Rubin (1987)) under uncongeniality (Meng (1994)). We present a general estimating-equation decomposition theorem, resulting in an analytic (asymptotic) description of MI inference as an integration of the knowledge of the imputer and the analyst, and establish a characterization of self-efficiency (Meng (1994)) for regulating estimation procedures. These results help to reveal how the quality of and relationship between the imputer’s model and analyst’s procedure affect MI inference, including how a seemingly perfect procedure under the “God-versus-me” paradigm is actually inadmissible when God’s, imputer’s, and analyst’s models are uncongenial to each other. Our theoretical investigation also leads to useful procedures that are as trivially implementable as Rubin’s combining rules, yet with confidence coverage guaranteed to be minimally the nominal level, under any degree of uncongeniality. We reveal that the relationship is very complex between the validity of approaches taken for individual phases and the validity of the final multi-phase inference, and indeed that it is a nontrivial matter to quantify or even qualify the meaning of validity itself in such settings. These results and many open problems are presented to raise the general awareness that the multi-phase inference paradigm is an uncongenial forest populated by thorns, as well as some fruits, many of which are still low-hanging.},

propose a Multiple Block-wise Imputation (MBI) approach, which incorporates
imputations based on both complete and incomplete observations. Specifically,
for a given missing pattern group, the imputations in MBI incorporate more
samples from groups with fewer observed variables in addition to the group with
complete observations. We propose to construct estimating equations based on
all available information, and integrate informative estimating functions to
achieve efficient estimators. We show that the proposed method has estimation
and model selection consistency under both fixed-dimensional and high-dimensional settings. Moreover, the proposed estimator is asymptotically more
efficient than the estimator based on a single imputation from complete
observations only. In addition, the proposed method is not restricted to missing
completely at random. Numerical studies and ADNI data application confirm that
the proposed method outperforms existing variable selection methods under
various missing mechanisms.},

The generator (G) observes some components of a real data vector, imputes the missing components conditioned on what is actually observed, and outputs a completed vector. The discriminator (D) then takes a completed vector and attempts to determine which components were actually observed and which were imputed. To ensure that D forces G to learn the desired distribution, we provide D with some additional information in the form of a hint vector. The hint reveals to D partial information about the missingness of the original sample, which is used by D to focus its attention on the imputation quality of particular components. This hint ensures that G does in fact learn to generate according to the true data distribution. We tested our method on various datasets and found that GAIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

  Abstract={We propose a novel imputation method for highly missing data. Though most existing imputation methods focus on moderate missing rate, imputation for high missing rate over 80\% is still important but challenging. As we expect that multiple imputation is indispensable for high missing rate, we propose a generative adversarial multiple imputation network (GAMIN) based on generative adversarial network (GAN) for multiple imputation. Compared with similar imputation methods adopting GAN, our method has three novel contributions: 1) We propose a novel imputation architecture which generates candidates of imputation. 2) We present a confidence prediction method to perform reliable multiple imputation. 3) We realize them with GAMIN and train it using novel loss functions based on the confidence. We synthesized highly missing datasets using MNIST and CelebA to perform various experiments. The results show that our method outperforms baseline methods at high missing rate from 80\% to 95\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing values widely exist in many real-world datasets, which hinders the performing of advanced data analytics. Properly filling these missing values is crucial but challenging, especially when the missing rate is high. Many approaches have been proposed for missing value imputation (MVI), but they are mostly heuristics-based, lacking a principled foundation and do not perform satisfactorily in practice. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework based on deep generative models for MVI. Under this framework, imputing the missing entries amounts to seeking a fixed-point solution between two conditional distributions defined on the missing entries and latent variables respectively. These distributions are parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs) which possess high approximation power and can capture the nonlinear relationships between missing entries and the observed values. The learning of weight parameters of DNNs is performed by maximizing an approximation of the log-likelihood of observed values. We conducted extensive evaluation on 13 datasets and compared with 11 baselines methods, where our methods largely outperforms the baselines.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing kNN imputation methods for dealing with missing data are designed according to Minkowski distance or its variants, and have been shown to be generally efficient for numerical variables (features, or attributes). To deal with heterogeneous (i.e., mixed-attributes) data, we propose a novel kNN (k nearest neighbor) imputation method to iteratively imputing missing data, named GkNN (gray kNN) imputation. GkNN selects k nearest neighbors for each missing datum via calculating the gray distance between the missing datum and all the training data rather than traditional distance metric methods, such as Euclidean distance. Such a distance metric can deal with both numerical and categorical attributes. For achieving the better effectiveness, GkNN regards all the imputed instances (i.e., the missing data been imputed) as observed data, which with complete instances (instances without missing values) together to iteratively impute other missing data. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and demonstrate that the gray distance is much better than the Minkowski distance at both capturing the proximity relationship (or nearness) of two instances and dealing with mixed attributes. Moreover, experimental results also show that the GkNN algorithm is much more efficient than existent kNN imputation methods.},

  Abstract={In the literature of statistical analysis with missing data there is a significant gap in statistical inference for missing data mechanisms especially for nonmonotone missing data, which has essentially restricted the use of the estimation methods which require estimating the missing data mechanisms. For example, the inverse probability weighting methods (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952; Little and Rubin, 2002), including the popular augmented inverse probability weighting (Robins et al, 1994), depend on sufficient models for the missing data mechanisms to reduce estimation bias while improving estimation efficiency. This research proposes a semiparametric likelihood method for estimating missing data mechanisms where an EM algorithm with closed form expressions for both E‐step and M‐step is used in evaluating the estimate (Zhao et al, 2009; Zhao, 2020). The asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator is estimated from the profile score function. The methods are general and robust. Simulation studies in various missing data settings are performed to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. Finally, we analysis the missing data mechanism of Duke cardiac catheterization coronary artery disease diagnostic data to illustrate the method.},

  Abstract={Missing data imputation forms the first critical step of many data analysis pipelines. The challenge is greatest for mixed data sets, including real, Boolean, and ordinal data, where standard techniques for imputation fail basic sanity checks: for example, the imputed values may not follow the same distributions as the data. This paper proposes a new semiparametric algorithm to impute missing values, with no tuning parameters. The algorithm models mixed data as a Gaussian copula. This model can fit arbitrary marginals for continuous variables and can handle ordinal variables with many levels, including Boolean variables as a special case. We develop an efficient approximate EM algorithm to estimate copula parameters from incomplete mixed data. The resulting model reveals the statistical associations among variables. Experimental results on several synthetic and real datasets show the superiority of our proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art imputation algorithms for mixed data.},

B 39 (1977) 1–38] for maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, and (b) the formulation of models for the joint distribution of the data Z and missing data indicators M, and associated "missing at random" (MAR) condition under which a model for M is unnecessary [Rubin, Biometrika 63 (1976) 581–592]. Most previous work has treated Z and M as single blocks, yielding selection or pattern-mixture models depending on how their joint distribution is factorized. This paper explores "block-sequential" models that interleave subsets of the variables and their missing data indicators, and then make parameter restrictions based on assumptions in each block. These include models that are not MAR. We examine a subclass of block-sequential models we call block-conditional MAR (BCMAR) models, and an associated block-monotone reduced likelihood strategy that typically yields consistent estimates by selectively discarding some data. Alternatively, full ML estimation can often be achieved via the EM algorithm. We examine in some detail BCMAR models for the case of two multinomially distributed categorical variables, and a two block structure where the first block is categorical and the second block arises from a (possibly multivariate) exponential family distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of high-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with missing observations. In simple, homogeneous missingness settings with a noise level of constant order, we show that an existing inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimator of the leading principal components can (nearly) attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence. However, deeper investigation reveals both that, particularly in more realistic settings where the missingness mechanism is heterogeneous, the empirical performance of the IPW estimator can be unsatisfactory, and moreover that, in the noiseless case, it fails to provide exact recovery of the principal components. Our main contribution, then, is to introduce a new method for high-dimensional PCA, called `primePCA', that is designed to cope with situations where observations may be missing in a heterogeneous manner. Starting from the IPW estimator, primePCA iteratively projects the observed entries of the data matrix onto the column space of our current estimate to impute the missing entries, and then updates our estimate by computing the leading right singular space of the imputed data matrix. It turns out that the interaction between the heterogeneity of missingness and the low-dimensional structure is crucial in determining the feasibility of the problem. We therefore introduce an incoherence condition on the principal components and prove that in the noiseless case, the error of primePCA converges to zero at a geometric rate when the signal strength is not too small. An important feature of our theoretical guarantees is that they depend on average, as opposed to worst-case, properties of the missingness mechanism. Our numerical studies on both simulated and real data reveal that primePCA exhibits very encouraging performance across a wide range of scenarios.},
