Feel free to pass on information, submit contributions (The <b>deadline for submissions is May 20 2020</b>), transfer to your students, colleagues, etc, also inform us (main contact: <a href="http://juliejosse.com" target="_blank">Julie Josse</a>) if you would be interested in seeing a particular topic discussed in a panel session (or to participate in a panel session).
