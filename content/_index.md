# Welcome to R-miss-tastic

> A community-driven platform on **missing data** in statistics and machine learning.

---

### Project Overview

**R-miss-tastic** is a platform funded by the **R Consortium (Infrastructure Steering Committee)**. Its mission is to provide a centralized, evolving reference for managing missing data in statistical workflows.

Our goals:

- ✅ Curate a list of **existing packages**,
- 📚 Share **available literature**,
- 🧠 Provide **theoretical and practical tutorials**,
- 🔄 Showcase **analysis workflows** in both **R** and **Python**,
- 👥 Highlight **main contributors and actors**,
- 📊 List **popular datasets**.

This website provides the main methods, references and implementations (in R and Python) for managing missing data — whether to impute, estimate or predict.<br>

<p align="justify">
If you are a <strong>user</strong>, you will find the main methods available depending on the nature of your data sets; courses on missing data and pipelines of analyses will help you determine which method is most suitable for your analysis.<br>

If you are a <strong>researcher</strong>, you will be able to find datasets, simulation tools, and templates to benchmark your methods against existing ones.
