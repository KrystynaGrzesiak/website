##### Package: 
Hmisc

##### Authors: 
Harrell Miscellaneous, Charles Dupont

##### Category:
Single and Multiple Imputation

##### Use-Cases:
Data summarization and exploration, handling missing data and imputation, regression modeling and splines, correlation analysis and statistical tests, data visualization, variable labeling and metadata management, data manipulation and transformation.

##### Popularity:
[![CRAN Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/Hmisc)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Hmisc)

##### Description:
Contains many functions useful for data analysis, high-level graphics, utility operations, functions for computing sample size and power, simulation, importing and annotating datasets, imputing missing values, advanced table making, variable clustering, character string manipulation, conversion of R objects to LaTeX and html code, recoding variables, caching, simplified parallel computing, encrypting and decrypting data using a safe workflow, general moving window statistical estimation, and assistance in interpreting principal component analysis.

##### Algorithms:
- impute(): Allows simple imputation (mean, median, or mode) of missing values.
- transcan(): Performs multiple imputation and transformation of missing data.
- aregImpute(): Performs multiple imputation using additive regression.
- fit.mult.impute(): Fits regression models to multiply imputed datasets.

##### Datasets:
none
