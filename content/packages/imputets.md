##### Package: 
imputeTS

##### Category:
Time-Series Imputation, Visualisations for Missing Data

##### Use-Cases:
Imputation for univariate time series, Imputation of Sensor data, Visualization of time series missing data

##### Popularity:
[![CRAN Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/imputeTS)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=imputeTS)

##### Description:
Imputation (replacement) of missing values in univariate time series. Offers several imputation functions and missing data plots. Available imputation algorithms include: 'Mean', 'LOCF', 'Interpolation', 'Moving Average', 'Seasonal Decomposition', 'Kalman Smoothing on Structural Time Series models', 'Kalman Smoothing on ARIMA models'.

#### Last update:
[![CRAN Release](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/last-release/imputeTS
)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=imputeTS)

##### Algorithms:
- Mean imputation (mean, mode, median)
- Last observation carried forward (locf)
- Next observation carried backward (nocb)
- Linear interpolation
- Spline interpolation
- Stineman interpolation
- Simple Moving Average
- Linear Weighted Moving Average
- Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
- Seasonal Decomposition based imputation
- Seasonal Split based imputation
- Kalman Smoothing on Structural Time Series models
- Kalman Smoothing on ARIMA models'

##### Datasets:
- tsAirgap (airpass dataset - Monthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949 to 1960)
- tsNH4 (Time series of NH4 concentration in a wastewater system)
- tsHeating (Time series of a heating systems supply temperature)

##### Input: 
vector, ts, data.frame, zoo, xts

##### Example:
~~~~ 
library(imputeTS)

print("print time-series with NAs")
print(tsAirgap)

#perform the missing value replacement
imp <- na.mean(tsAirgap) 

print("print the series with the imputations")
print(imp)

#Visualize the imputations
plotNA.imputations(imp, x.withNA = tsAirgap)gap)
